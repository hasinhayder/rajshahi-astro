# Rajshahi Blog - Astro Theme

A melancholic and contemplative blog theme built with Astro, inspired by the serene beauty of Rajshahiâ€”a city that holds countless childhood memories and shaped my appreciation for quiet moments.

## About Rajshahi

Rajshahi is a city in northwestern Bangladesh that carries an old-world charm unlike any other. During my childhood, it was a place where time seemed to move slowerâ€”where ancient mango trees lined peaceful streets, where the Padma River whispered stories of bygone eras, and where every sunset painted the sky in hues that words can barely capture.

The city's colonial architecture, with its red-brick buildings and wide verandas, created an atmosphere of gentle nostalgia. The University of Rajshahi campus, with its sprawling grounds and academic tranquility, felt like a sanctuary of learning and reflection. These memories of a scenic, peaceful, and beautifully aged town have deeply influenced the aesthetic and philosophy behind this blog theme.

## A Note on Nostalgia

```js
// Sometimes, the simplest code holds the deepest meaning.
// Like memories, each line is quiet, but together they tell a story.

const nostalgia = [
  "Mango trees in the afternoon sun", 
  "The hush of the Padma River at dusk", 
  "Red-brick walls echoing with laughter", 
  "Pages filled with handwritten dreams"
]

function reflect(memories) {
  return memories.map((m) => `Remember: ${m}`)
}

console.log(reflect(nostalgia).join("\n"))

// May your blog, like these memories, be a gentle space for reflection.
```
